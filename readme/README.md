# üåç Global Warming: Human Influence Outweighs Natural Causes  

##  INTRODUCTION
Global warming is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. But is it primarily caused by human activity?  
This study investigates the connection between **human-generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** and **temperature changes** over time, while also evaluating the potential role of **natural factors** such as volcanic activity.  

We compared data from **six countries**:  
- High-emission, industrialized nations: **China, India, United Kingdom**  
- Low-emission island nations: **Micronesia, Dominica, Tonga**  

The results highlight how human intervention is the primary driver of global warming.

## OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to comprehensively evaluate the drivers of global warming by integrating multi-country datasets on greenhouse gas emissions, temperature changes, and natural climate influences. Specifically, this study seeks to:
1.	Analyse historical and contemporary trends in key greenhouse gases (CO‚ÇÇ, methane, and nitrous oxide) and evaluate their relationship with rising global temperatures.
2.	Investigate the role of natural factors such as volcanic aerosols in explaining short-term climate variability, while distinguishing them from long-term human-driven warming trends.
3.	Assess the contribution of wildfires both as an impact of global warming (driven by increasing temperatures and prolonged dry seasons) and as an additional source of GHG emissions that further intensify warming.
4.	Compare the warming trajectories of high-emission nations (e.g., China, India, UK) and low-emission nations (e.g., Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia) to highlight inequities in climate impacts.
5.	Provide evidence to strengthen the understanding of global warming‚Äôs primary drivers and inform policies aimed at mitigating emissions and supporting vulnerable nations.
Ultimately, the project aims to show that while short-term variations may arise from natural processes, the persistent upward trend in global temperatures is overwhelmingly driven by human activity, with wildfires acting as a compounding impact-and-cause feedback mechanism. This underscores the urgency of reducing emissions and building resilience against climate impacts.

# SECTION 1: 
## GREENHOUSE GASES  

## CO‚ÇÇ EMISSIONS  
CO‚ÇÇ is the most abundant human-generated GHG, produced mainly through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes. It persists in the atmosphere for centuries, making it the primary driver of long-term warming.


![CO‚ÇÇ Emissions](figures/co2_emissions_plot.png)  

1. China (blue)
* The most prominent curve in the graph.
* CO‚ÇÇ emissions were low until the late 1950s, began rising slowly, then accelerated dramatically after 2000.
* By 2025, China surpasses 11 billion tons/year ‚Äî nearly 10√ó more than its 1970s level.
* This surge corresponds to China‚Äôs industrialization, urbanization, and reliance on coal-based energy. It is a direct link between human activity and emissions growth.

2. India (green)
* Emissions start low and begin rising gradually around 1950‚Äì1960, but acceleration happens after 1990.
* In 2025, India's emissions are around 2.5‚Äì3 billion tons/year ‚Äî steadily rising.
* India‚Äôs rise parallels population growth, expanding energy needs, and agricultural intensification. The steady rise reinforces the human-made emissions narrative ‚Äî especially in the Global South.

3. United Kingdom (brown)
* The only country that shows an early rise (mid-1800s) and a plateau/fall after ~1970.
* UK emissions peak around 1900‚Äì1950, then decline steadily after 1980.
* This reflects the UK‚Äôs early industrialization and later transition to cleaner energy sources, better efficiency, and climate policy. It provides historical proof that human decisions and policy can reduce emissions.

4. Tonga / Dominica / Micronesia (pink/purple/orange)
* All three show flat lines near zero throughout the entire period.
* No significant contribution to global CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
* These countries contribute negligibly to global emissions yet but still experience warming.

Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change, primarily released through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial activities. It is the most abundant long-lived greenhouse gas, remaining in the atmosphere for centuries and acting as the primary driver of sustained global warming.
Our analysis shows steep increases in CO‚ÇÇ emissions from industrializing nations such as China and India, especially after the 1950s, with China now the dominant global emitter. The United Kingdom, while historically one of the highest emitters, has seen emissions steadily decline since the 1970s due to policy shifts and a transition away from coal. Small island nations such as Tonga, Dominica, and Micronesia remain negligible contributors throughout the period.
The plot reveals that China exhibits exponential growth in emissions beginning in the 1980s, while India follows a steadier upward trajectory. By contrast, the UK shows a clear downward path, reflecting decarbonization efforts. The sustained rise in emissions from emerging economies directly parallels their industrial and economic growth, strongly supporting the case that global warming is primarily driven by human activity rather than natural variability.



## CH‚ÇÑ EMISSIONS
Methane (CH‚ÇÑ) is a potent greenhouse gas ‚Äî over 25√ó more powerful than CO‚ÇÇ in trapping heat over a 100-year period. Key human sources include:
* Livestock digestion (enteric fermentation)
* Rice paddies
* Landfills
* Oil and gas operations
  
![CH‚ÇÑ Emissions](figures/methane_emissions_plot.png)

1. China (blue line)
* Methane emissions were steady and moderate until the 1950s
* Post-1960s, emissions began a rapid and steady exponential increase
* Massive acceleration observed after 1980 and especially post-2000
* By 2025, China‚Äôs methane emissions approach 1.9 billion tons CO‚ÇÇ-eq/year
* Reflects China‚Äôs livestock boom, large-scale rice cultivation, waste expansion, and fossil fuel industry growth. Strong evidence of human-induced methane emissions on a national scale.

2. India (green line)
* Emissions start high even in the 1800s ‚Äî likely due to agriculture and livestock, which have long been central to India's economy
* Moderate growth between 1850‚Äì1950, but steep growth from 1970 onward
* India reaches over 1 billion tons CO‚ÇÇ-eq/year by 2025
* India‚Äôs emissions largely stem from agricultural methane, especially cattle and rice. Strong human link, especially in the agriculture sector.

3. United Kingdom (brown line)
* Methane emissions show a long, flat increase from 1850 to about 1990, followed by a clear decline
* By 2025, the UK‚Äôs methane emissions are down significantly ‚Äî below 0.1 billion tons
* This decline reflects methane abatement policies (e.g., improved livestock management, better landfills, reduced coal mining). Demonstrates that policy interventions can reduce emissions.

4. Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia (pink, orange, purple ‚Äî nearly flat lines)
* Emissions are essentially flat and near zero throughout the time period
* These small island nations have minimal agricultural or industrial methane sources, yet they still suffer warming ‚Äî supports your climate injustice argument (i.e., affected by others‚Äô emissions).

China and India show consistent growth in methane emissions, with a marked acceleration after the 1970s driven by agricultural expansion, livestock farming, and waste sector development. The United Kingdom, in contrast, demonstrates a steady decline in emissions after the 1990s, reflecting the success of regulatory measures and improved management practices. Small island nations contribute only negligible amounts of methane, yet remain among the most vulnerable to its warming effects, underscoring the disproportionate burden on low-emission countries. Overall, these trends highlight how human-driven agricultural and industrial activities are key contributors to rising methane levels and global warming.


## N‚ÇÇO EMISSIONS
N‚ÇÇO (nitrous oxide) is a potent greenhouse gas: ~298√ó more powerful than CO‚ÇÇ per molecule (on a 100-year scale). Main human sources:
* Agricultural soil management (synthetic fertilizers, manure)
* Livestock waste
* Fossil fuel combustion
* Industrial processes (e.g., nitric acid production)
  
![N‚ÇÇO Emissions](figures/no2_emissions_plot.png)  

1. China (blue line)
* Minimal emissions pre-1950
* Rapid exponential rise from 1960s, peaking around 2005‚Äì2015
* Recent dip or leveling off but still the highest emitter in this group
* Emissions exceed 4√ó10‚Å∏ tons CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent
* This mirrors the green revolution, fertilizer-intensive farming, and rapid industrialization.
* The rise strongly supports the anthropogenic origin of greenhouse gas emissions.

2. India (green line)
* Starts with slightly elevated emissions even in the 1800s, likely due to traditional agriculture
* Growth picks up from 1950s, with consistent increase
* By 2025, India reaches close to 3√ó10‚Å∏ tons CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent
* Fertilizer use, animal waste management, and farming practices drive N‚ÇÇO rise. This is another human-driven trajectory, especially from agriculture, not nature.

3. United Kingdom (brown line)
* Shows steady increase until ~1990s, followed by visible decline
* Today sits below 1√ó10‚Å∏ tons, having dropped ~40% from peak
* UK‚Äôs emissions fall due to agricultural reform, reduced fertilizer use, and environmental policy. Strong example of successful climate governance.

4. Tonga / Dominica / Micronesia (pink, purple, orange lines ‚Äî flat at bottom)
* Lines remain flat and near-zero across the timeline
* These countries produce negligible nitrous oxide, supporting the idea that small island nations are victims, not contributors to global warming.

China exhibits a sharp rise in nitrous oxide emissions after the 1960s, largely driven by the widespread use of industrial fertilizers and the expansion of intensive agriculture. India shows steady growth beginning in the 1950s, reflecting similar agricultural trends. In contrast, the United Kingdom‚Äôs emissions declined after the 1990s, following agricultural reforms and stronger environmental regulations. Small island nations such as Tonga, Micronesia, and Dominica contribute virtually no emissions, yet remain highly exposed to the consequences of global warming. These patterns reinforce the conclusion that greenhouse gas emissions‚Äîand the resulting temperature rise‚Äîare overwhelmingly linked to human activity, particularly in the agricultural sector.

## LAND ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED FOR MEAT OVER TIME
This graph illustrates the number of land animals slaughtered for meat annually across six countries from 1960 to 2025.

![Animal Slaughter](figures/animal_slaughter_plot.png)  

1. China (blue line)
* Steady increase from 1960, then rapid growth post-1980
* Explosive growth from 1990‚Äì2025
* By 2025, China slaughters >17 billion animals annually
* This enormous growth matches China‚Äôs industrial meat production boom, dietary shifts (more meat consumption), and population growth.
* Strongly explains the parallel rise in CH‚ÇÑ and N‚ÇÇO emissions you observed in earlier graphs.

2. India (green line)
* Starts very low (~1960), grows slowly until 1990
* Post-1990: Steady and moderate growth
* By 2025: ~3.5‚Äì4 billion animals per year
* India‚Äôs meat industry is smaller than China‚Äôs due to cultural factors (e.g., beef restrictions), but still significant.
* Contributes to methane emissions via livestock and dairy sectors.

3. United Kingdom (brown line)
* Flat growth trend ‚Äî small increase from 1960s to 2025
* Appears relatively stable at ~1‚Äì1.2 billion animals/year
* The UK‚Äôs relatively flat line correlates with its stabilized CH‚ÇÑ and declining N‚ÇÇO emissions.
* Likely due to meat consumption plateauing and/or efficient farming practices.

4. Tonga / Dominica / Micronesia (pink, orange, purple lines)
* All three show negligible slaughter numbers, essentially flat
* Minimal livestock industries ‚Üí negligible methane/nitrous oxide emissions.
* Yet they are experiencing warming ‚Äî again supporting climate injustice.

China shows an exponential rise, exceeding 17 billion animals per year, driven by increased meat consumption and industrial agriculture. India also shows a steady upward trend. The UK remains relatively flat, reflecting stable dietary trends. Small island nations (Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia) remain near-zero, indicating negligible contributions to agricultural GHG emissions. These trends explain the methane and nitrous oxide emission patterns seen earlier and link dietary behavior to climate change.


## TEMPERATURE CHANGE OVER TIME 
Annual temperature anomalies from 1960 to 2025 across six countries.
![Temperature Change](figures/temperature_change.png)  

General Warming Trend Across All Countries
* All six countries show a clear upward trend in temperature anomalies since the 1960s
* The post-1990s period shows strongest warming, particularly after 2000
* 2023‚Äì2025 period reaches >2¬∞C above baseline in China and ~1.5¬∞C in Tonga, Dominica, and UK
* This visually confirms the global nature of warming ‚Äî not regional or isolated.

1. China (Blue line)
* Starts near baseline (~0¬∞C anomaly)
* Shows strong, continuous warming especially after 1995
* By 2025: reaches 2.5¬∞C anomaly
* Matches the pattern of China's exponential CO‚ÇÇ and CH‚ÇÑ emissions. A classic case of human-caused warming.

3. India (Green line)
* Starts with some fluctuations around zero
* Warming is visible but slightly less steep than China
* By 2025: anomaly is ~1.0‚Äì1.2¬∞C
* Also aligns with India‚Äôs steady emissions growth ‚Äî agriculture-driven CH‚ÇÑ and fertilizer-based N‚ÇÇO likely contributors.

4. United Kingdom (Brown line)
* Higher variance in early years, but steady upward trend post-1980
* By 2025: anomaly is ~1.5‚Äì1.7¬∞C, despite reduced emissions
* Important evidence that warming is global, not solely local ‚Äî even as UK‚Äôs emissions declined, warming continued.

5. Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia (Purple, Orange, Red)
* All start near 0¬∞C with minimal anomalies before 1980
* After 1990: clear warming trend
* 2025 values reach ~1.2 to 1.7¬∞C
* These countries contribute virtually nothing to emissions (confirmed by the earlier GHG plots), yet their temperature is rising ‚Äî highlighting climate injustice. They are warming due to global emissions, not local sources.


All countries show a clear warming trend, with China and the United Kingdom reaching anomalies above 2¬∞C. Small Island Nations like Tonga, Dominica, and Micronesia ‚Äî despite contributing negligibly to global emissions ‚Äî also show significant warming. These trends visually confirm that global temperature rise is not limited to high-emitting nations and supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming with disproportionate impact on vulnerable nations.

# SECTION 2:
## VOLCANIC AEROSOLS  

![Volcanic Aerosols](figures/global_saod.png)  

This graph shows the Global Average Stratospheric Aerosol Optical Depth (SAOD) over time from the mid-1980s to around 2025.
Baseline levels (1985‚Äì1990, post-2000):
* SAOD values are generally very low (~0.002‚Äì0.01).
* These represent periods without major volcanic activity, when the stratosphere is relatively clear.
Major spike (1991‚Äì1995):
       * A sharp increase in SAOD peaking above 0.10 around 1991‚Äì1992.
*  This corresponds to the Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991, one of the   largest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century.
       * The eruption injected massive amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere,  forming aerosols that reflected sunlight and cooled the Earth for several years.
       * SAOD gradually declined back to baseline levels by ~1996.
1.	Post-Pinatubo period (2000‚Äì2020):
              * SAOD remained relatively stable and low, with small fluctuations likely due to minor volcanic eruptions and background aerosol variability.
2.	Recent increases (around 2020‚Äì2023):
       * There are noticeable but much smaller spikes compared to Pinatubo.
       * Likely linked to more recent volcanic activity (e.g., the 2022 Hunga Tonga‚ÄìHunga Ha ªapai eruption) and possibly wildfires, which can also inject aerosols into the stratosphere.

The graph shows that large volcanic eruptions are the dominant driver of major short-term increases in stratospheric aerosol loading, leading to significant but temporary impacts on the global atmosphere and climate. In contrast, during quiescent periods, SAOD remains very low and stable. The recent smaller spikes indicate that while moderate eruptions and events can influence stratospheric aerosols, their global impact is far less pronounced than that of a major eruption like Pinatubo.


## DISASTER DEATHS OVER TIME

This shows the number of people killed per year in each country due to disasters, which may include:
* Floods
* Storms
* Droughts
* Heatwaves
* Earthquakes

![Disaster Deaths](figures/disaster_deaths_plot.png)  

1. China (blue line)
* Shows the highest disaster death tolls of all countries, particularly:
* Spikes in 1930s and 1940s, exceeding 3.5 million deaths in one year
* Sustained high fatalities through the 1950s and early 1960s
* Post-1980: Sharp decline in disaster deaths
* The early 20th century disasters were likely linked to massive floods, famines, and droughts ‚Äî some of which may be climate-related.
The steep decline post-1980 likely reflects improved infrastructure, disaster warning systems, and policy responses.

2. India (green line)
* Several extreme spikes:
* One close to 1.2 million deaths around 1900
* Another peak (~1.5 million) in 1940s
* A few smaller spikes in the 1950s‚Äì1970s
* Post-1980: Relatively flat line
* Like China, India's highest disaster fatalities occurred during pre-modernization periods, likely from floods, drought-induced famines, and extreme heatwaves.
* Decline in deaths reflects national preparedness and possibly economic development.

3. United Kingdom (brown line)
* Entire line is flat and near-zero
* UK has almost no visible disaster deaths over the time span
* The UK‚Äôs temperate climate, strong infrastructure, and governance mitigate the scale of fatalities ‚Äî despite occasional severe weather.

4. Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia (purple, orange, red lines)
* All remain flat and extremely close to zero
* No large disaster fatalities are recorded in this dataset
* These countries are not historically major disaster death zones, possibly due to: Small populations, Effective regional response, Underreporting
* However, modern climate change increases their vulnerability to future sea level rise, cyclones, and storm surges.

China and India experienced massive fatal disasters, particularly in the early 20th century, with spikes exceeding 1 million deaths. These events were likely linked to floods, droughts, and climate-sensitive conditions. Since the 1980s, fatalities have declined, especially in China, indicating improved disaster resilience. The UK shows minimal disaster deaths throughout, while small island nations show almost no fatalities, despite being highly vulnerable to modern sea level rise and storms. This plot underscores the unequal human impact of climate change and the importance of adaptive capacity.

# SECTION 4: 
## WILDFIRES 

Annual area burnt by wildfires (2012‚Äì2025) across selected countries.
![Wildfires](figures/wildfire_plot.png)  

1. India (green line)
* Clearly the most affected by wildfires in this dataset
* Yearly area burnt ranges between 5 million to 11.5 million hectares
* Sharp peaks in 2016 and 2021, indicating severe fire years
* Shows high volatility, suggesting erratic fire patterns, possibly linked to: Temperature anomalies, Drought events, Land-use changes, Agricultural burning practices
* Worsening wildfire activity in India correlates with both rising temperature and emissions (seen in your previous plots). Likely driven by climate feedback loops ‚Äî warming ‚Üí droughts ‚Üí fires ‚Üí more GHG emissions.

2. China (blue line)
* More stable than India but still burns between 1.5‚Äì5.5 million hectares annually
* Peaks around 2014‚Äì2015, dips in 2018, and remains moderately stable
* Reflects China‚Äôs massive forest and grassland coverage, population pressure, and climate stress. This reinforces the idea that human and climatic drivers both influence fire dynamics.

3. United Kingdom, Tonga, Dominica, Micronesia
* All show flat lines near zero
* It shows no significant wildfire activity
* Small nations and the UK are not facing large-scale wildfires, but still suffer climate impacts (e.g., floods, storms).
* Their absence here does not contradict warming, just shows impact varies by geography.

India records the highest and most variable wildfire activity, with annual burned areas exceeding 11 million hectares in some years. China also shows consistent wildfire occurrence, though with lower volatility compared to India. By contrast, small island nations and the United Kingdom experience negligible wildfire activity. These patterns highlight the strong connection between rising global temperatures and increased wildfire risk, reinforcing that climate change not only drives warming but also amplifies climate-related hazards. Wildfires, in turn, release significant amounts of CO‚ÇÇ and other greenhouse gases, creating a feedback loop that accelerates global warming and its environmental consequences.

#  CONCLUSION
The collected evidence from greenhouse gas emissions, temperature anomalies, wildfire patterns, volcanic activity, and disaster records converges on a single, undeniable reality: **global warming is primarily human-driven, with natural factors playing only temporary or localized roles.**  

- The steep and sustained rise in CO‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ, and N‚ÇÇO emissions from industrializing nations such as China and India mirrors their population growth, industrial expansion, and agricultural intensification.  
- In contrast, the United Kingdom demonstrates that proactive policy, cleaner energy transitions, and agricultural reforms can stabilize and even reduce emissions.  
- Small island nations such as Tonga, Dominica, and Micronesia contribute virtually nothing to global emissions, yet still endure the same warming trends ‚Äî a stark example of climate injustice.  
- The temperature anomaly data confirms that warming is universal, transcending national boundaries: both high-emission and low-emission countries have experienced rising temperatures, with post-1990 acceleration pushing anomalies above 2¬∞C in some regions.  
- The role of natural factors, such as volcanic aerosols, is evident in short-lived cooling episodes (e.g., Mount Pinatubo in 1991), but these events are temporary interruptions rather than explanations for the long-term upward trajectory of global temperatures.  
- Likewise, disaster death tolls reveal how modernization, infrastructure, and policy have reduced vulnerability in nations like China and India, while countries with limited adaptive capacity remain at high risk from emerging climate threats.  
- Wildfires stand out as both a symptom and a catalyst of climate change ‚Äî intensified by higher temperatures and drier conditions, they in turn release massive greenhouse gases, locking the planet into a feedback cycle of worsening warming and hazards.  
- Similarly, the surge in meat production and animal slaughter in emerging economies directly explains rising methane and nitrous oxide emissions, linking dietary and agricultural choices to the climate crisis.  

**Taken together, these datasets form a clear narrative:**  
- Human activity is the dominant driver of global warming.  
- Natural events provide only short-term deviations.  
- Vulnerable, low-emission nations bear disproportionate burdens.  
- Policy, technology, and lifestyle choices matter ‚Äî as shown by the UK‚Äôs emissions decline and the accelerating risks in developing regions.  

The conclusion is inescapable: **addressing global warming is not optional but urgent.**  

Mitigation through emissions reduction, sustainable agriculture, and energy transition must be paired with adaptation and equity, ensuring that nations least responsible for the crisis are supported in building resilience.  

Without decisive global cooperation, the feedback loops of warming, disasters, and environmental degradation will intensify ‚Äî threatening ecosystems, economies, and human survival worldwide.
